## Data Overview

The dataset used for this analysis contains information related to car insurance claims. It includes various attributes such as driver gender, car age, car type, claim frequency, median income, and more. The data provides insights into the factors affecting claim frequencies and car popularity.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis approach can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Data**: The project began with a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and variables.

2. **Formulating Questions**: Key questions were formulated based on the initial observations. Three significant questions that arose were:
   - **Question 1**: Why majority of claims has come from middle age group(60-80 according to data set)
   - **Question 2**: Why do female drivers have a significantly higher number of claims compared to male drivers?
   - **Question 3**: Why do SUVs have the highest number of claims compared to other car types?

3. **Gender vs. Claim Frequency Analysis**: A bar chart was created to compare gender and claim frequency. It was observed that female drivers have significantly more claims than male drivers, leading to the first question.

4. **Car Age Categorization**: Car age was categorized into new, moderate, old, and very old based on calculated fields. However, this did not yield significant insights.

5. **Gender vs. Car Use Analysis**: Analysis of gender vs. car use revealed that most private vehicles are owned by females. Further analysis showed that private vehicles have a higher claim frequency, explaining the higher number of claims by female drivers.

6. **SUVs vs. Other Car Types Analysis**: Several charts were analyzed to understand why SUVs have the most claims. It was discovered that SUVs are the most popular car category, which naturally leads to more claims from this category.

7. **Understanding SUV Popularity**: To answer why SUVs are popular among car users, bar charts were created to assess the relationship between median income and car type and bluebook value and car type. It was found that SUVs are affordable to the middle-class population, which forms a significant portion of car users.

## Key Findings

The key findings and insights from the analysis include:

- The majority of vehicle users belong to this category, and this naturally has an impact on the frequency of claims made by this category as well.
- Female drivers have more claims due to their ownership of more private vehicles.
- SUVs have the highest number of claims due to their popularity among car users, driven by affordability.

## Visualizations

The project includes a series of visualizations created using Tableau to represent the data and findings effectively.
